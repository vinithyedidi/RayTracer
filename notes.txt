So I have a solid plan for how I'm gonna make this come together. I'll write them down here.

    1. Finish ray tracing:
         I have a solid ray tracer set up — it's way too fancy for anything I could possibly need,
         so I'll cut it down. I don't need to generate too many textures, though that was actually
         cool as fuck to learn about. Tomorrow all I need to learn is motion and motion blur, and
         then I'm ready to get cracking.

         My mission for tomorrow is to get my ray tracer working with motion of the camera and the
         sphere I create. I want to incorporate WASD/mouse controls like it's a video game, and you
         can drag and drop spheres and create new ones.

         I'll upload this to Github, and then make a new version without all the fancy features for
         use in my project.

    2. Orbital equations
        Once I get that working, then I found a nice online textbook for the orbital equations —
         I'll have to figure out how in the fuck to solve them in C++, but they're there. The solutions
         to those equations will determine the positions of those spheres. And after that, it's just
         refactoring, retooling, optimizing, and writing the thing up. I should be done sometime next
         week I should think. It'll be lit.

The next project I'm thinking of should be fairly simple. Maybe a terminal app, that doesn't sound
super hard compared to this one. This one is a huge fucking project but I think I have it in the bag.
I'll take a day or two off and then get to work. Also starting Monday, it's one application per day.

Alright. Enjoy your friday night. Pop an eddy. Go for a walk or something. It's lit.
